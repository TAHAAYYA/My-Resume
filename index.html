<p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m <b>Taha Ayya</b>, a recent high school graduate with a passion for all things web-related. </p>
<hr/>

<h2>Hereâ€™s a glimpse into my world:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>My journey began with HTML tags and CSS stylesheets. Iâ€™ve tinkered with JavaScript, danced with React.
        js, and even whispered sweet nothings to Node.js. The thrill of turning lines of code into functional 
        websites? Itâ€™s my adrenaline rush.</li>
    
    <li>Beyond the syntax, I appreciate aesthetics. Fonts, colors, layoutsâ€”I devour them like a hungry developer.
         Crafting user-friendly interfaces? Itâ€™s my jam.</li>    
    
    <li> Bugs? Theyâ€™re my puzzle pieces. I dive into the console, hunting down errors like a digital Sherlock.
         And when I fix that glitch? Cue the victory dance!</li>     

    <li>I dream of building sleek interactive apps, and maybe even a personal blog.
         Learning never stopsâ€”Iâ€™m eyeing those full-stack skills next.</li>     
</ul>

<p>So, whether itâ€™s pixels or APIs, Iâ€™m here to create, learn, and make the web a better place. Letâ€™s connect!
     </p>

<p>Remember, your journey is just beginning. Keep coding, stay curious, and embrace the magic of web development!</p>
